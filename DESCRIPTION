Description: Companion data package for the article "The effect of statistical 
  normalization on network propagation scores", 
  https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa896. Contains data for DLBCL 
  analysis (KEGG pathway-gene mapping, Release 83.0+/09-09) and for 
  the retrospective pathway prediction (legacy KEGG pathways 
  from 2011 in KEGG.db, a more current mapping from 2018, 
  Release 87.0+/08-10), and the BioGRID protein-protein 
  interaction network from 2018.
